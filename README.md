## Odin Plugin Readme
### Goal
The goal is to create a backend engine that will generate a common sense database from the users notes. this includes NLP to parse the text into typeDB and typedb as the main reasoning engine.
This is my first plugin, so in reality I am learning how to do things.
I will first do simple tasks, and will develop it into something usefull. Perhaps I can do a simple prototype first.
